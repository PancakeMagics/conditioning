// topic vs field:

// topics are more generic, may occur in everyone's daily life,
// an element inside a topic is kind of meme or post, like instagram, twitter, line

// fields are more specific to be learned,
// an element inside a field is kind of new thing like course, PBL, dreaming process,
// which may be happy after learning those of things,
// every user can gain experience to grow up in a field!
